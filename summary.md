## introduction
this repository aimed to summerize important things in the book of "approaching any maching learning problems" written by Abhishek Thakur. 

## Supervised vs unsupervised learning
**Supervised data**: always has one or multiple targets associated with it.<br>
**Unsupervised data** : does not have any target variable.

If the target is categorical, the problem becomes a classification problem. And if the target is a real number, the problem is defined as a regression problem. Thus, supervised problems can be divided into two sub-classes:

**Classification**: predicting a category, e.g. dog or cat.<br>
**Regression**: predicting a value, e.g. house prices.
